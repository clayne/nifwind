WIP (until proven otherwise)
 - everything is in "namespace nifwind"
 - every type/const/def/global starts with capital N
 - every class member is prefixed by its access specifier
 - class member(s) of the same class are always referenced explicitly: "this->"
 - (TODO) class members that aren't functions are suffixed with _
 - (TODO) filename matches class-name: case-insensitive
 - "//TODO" - do this ASAP
 - "//TODONT" - don't do this
 - "//PERHAPS" - an idea to be considered
 - "//LATER" - do this at the next major version
 - function calls get one  " ": "foo ("
 - init: "a{4}" - POT=4, "a {4}" - constructor call
 - use the full power of the "Qt" framework, for now
