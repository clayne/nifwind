 What is it?
.............

 f(nif, ffd)


 But, what is it?
..................

 A tool for studying the "Net Immerse File" format: .nif files.


 Why?
......

Because studying the "nif" file format is important. Also, this is my "thank
you" to the modding community.
But most importantly: I need to improve my 3D math. skills.


 The format
............

 List<Object>, where Object : ISerializable
             , where "Object *" is an index at the List

Most objects are named, and their names are stored at the file.


 How to build it
.................

 <> "*nix":
  > export QTDIR="the place qt5 is"
  > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=":${QTDIR}/lib"
  > export PATH+=":${QTDIR}/bin"
  > make
 <> "Windows":
  > install the "Windows SDK", and the "Open GL" headers
  > install your favorite "visual studio"
  > build qt-5.15.3
  > create a project, etc.; sooner or later "cmake" will come into play;
    then the project will be auto-generated by "cmake"


 What must be
..............

 [ ] view, edit, craft
 [ ] proper terminology and consistent source code
 [ ] libnifwind
 [ ] plug-ins
 [ ] visual file format editor
 [ ] specify the entire file structure in the description
 [ ] the code should match not by name, but by purpose
 [ ] thumbnail generator
