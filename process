Or what happens while I'm waiting for the test-suite to complete:

How would the monolithic nif_ffd will be transformed into multiple simple ffd?

  1. Parse a set of files - say per program.
  2. Print the syntax tree that was used.

The above creates the foundation of the file forge: the FFD is gaining the
ability to generate itself based on an instance tree - a tree you should be able
to build at the visual FFD editor.
