This project requires a lot of time.

"nif.xml" was transformed to my FFD.

Proof of concept:
 - render the instance tree
 - render the syntax tree
 - render a 3D mesh
 - add "python" scripting - write a script to list all nodes of a chosen type
 - render the instance data in a hexadecimal view with areas colored according
   to the syntax tree
     - create the nif header from scratch (load some binary data and start with
       an empty syntax tree)
 - transform nif_ffd to multiple simple ffd
 - xml import/export
