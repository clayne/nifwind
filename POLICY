This program is being created for educational purposes only. For me/you to
learn one of the many ways that professional 3D scene persistence is being
done by the big computer game companies. As you probably know the "NIF" is
used by many AAA computer games.

There will be no money involved in relation to this project. By offering money,
for lets say: to implement something, you're endangering the project - the big
AAA can shut it down in a blink of an eye, at any time, for any reason.
Please, don't do that - both of you. Thank you.

"version not supported" issues are no more. Particular NIF version "support" is
not an issue of this project. There are wizards out there that can create file
format description from binary data; I'm not one of them. There will be no
monolithic file format description, like "nif.xml", at this project, so if you
want to study a particular NIF variant, you can create a project for its
description and find a wizard willing to help you. Then you could use your
XML/FFD with "nifwind", to learn. Of course, I hope that the big AAA would
decide to publish their NIF file format descriptions. Who knows. Have you tried
asking them?
